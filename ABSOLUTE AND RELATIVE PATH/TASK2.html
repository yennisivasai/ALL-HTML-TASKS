<h2>CARROM : </h2>
<h3>The game of carrom originated in India. One carrom board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India. State-level competitions were being held in the different states of India during the early part of the 20th century. Serious carrom tournaments may have begun in Sri Lanka in 1935; by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes.</h3>

 <h2>CHESS : </h2>   
 <h3>Chess is a board game for two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). <br><br>

    Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture. There are several ways a game can end in a draw.</h3>

    <h2>LUDO : </h2>
    <h3>Special areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens[c] in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped playspace, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's home column. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing square, often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting "arrows" pointing to the finish).</h3>
    <h2>RULES :</h2>
    <h3>Rule No. 1: The game starts with each player choosing a set of four pieces (usually colored red, blue, green, and yellow) and placing them on the starting square. <br><br>

        Rule No. 2: The objective of the game is to move all four pieces around the board and return them to the starting square before your opponents. <br><br>
        
        Rule No. 3: On each turn, players roll two dice to determine how many spaces they can move their pieces. <br><br>
        
        Rule No. 4: The number on each die represents how many spaces a piece can move. For example, if a player rolls a 3 and a 6, they can move one piece 3 spaces and another piece 6 spaces. <br><br>
        
        Rule No. 5: Pieces can only move forward, never backward. <br> <br>
        
        Rule No. 6: If a piece lands on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, it can "knock off" that piece and send it back to the starting square.</h3>

        <h2>CRICKET : </h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"title="Cricket">Cricket Wikipedia </a>
        <h3>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</h3> <br>

        <h3>Kabaddi (/kəˈbædi/, /ˈkʌbədi/) is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players, originating in ancient India. The objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to the game after each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.</h3> <br>
