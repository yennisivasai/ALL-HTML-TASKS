   <p>Chilli Paneer, a vegetarian variant of Chilli Chicken, is one of the most popular dishes in Indian Chinese cuisine. Firstly, the paneer cubes are floured or battered before being deep-fried.

            <p>Chicken curry or curry/curried chicken is a South Asian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and Kenya. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_curry"target="chicken" class="abb">VIEWMORE</a> </p>

        <p>Kadai chicken is a simple, spicy dish and is traditionally made in a cast iron wok, but you can use a dutch oven or large saute pan instead. Kadai (or Karahi) just means “wok”  therefore, Kadai Chicken translates to Wok Chicken.
        It’s not the most creative name… but it is pretty straightforward. If I could rename the dish, I’d call it “tasty chicken smothered in a thick, spicy tomato masala sauce made with freshly ground spices” or something slightly shorter than that. <a href="https://myheartbeets.com/kadai-chicken/"target="khadai" class="abb">VIEWMORE</a> </p>
